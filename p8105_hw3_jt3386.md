We first read in the data.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. To be
